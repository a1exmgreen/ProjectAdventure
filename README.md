# ProjectAdventure
Repository for DnD inspired Pygame.

Description:
I want to create a text and pixel art adventure pygame (based on DnD 5e). It will include features like race and class selector, dice rolling, stats (Strength, dexterity, intellegience etc.), key locations (Waterdeep, Kraghammer, Underdark, Baldur's Gate etc.) Might use AI to make choices that matter - would need to build my own AI to fuel this. I'll create pixel art assets (dice, characters, locations, maps etc.) to aid this.
