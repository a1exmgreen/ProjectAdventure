# ProjectAdventure
Repository for DnD inspired Pygame.

<h2>Description:</h2>

I want to create a text and pixel art adventure pygame (based on DnD 5e). It will include features like race and class selector, dice rolling, stats (Strength, dexterity, intellegience etc.), key locations (Waterdeep, Kraghammer, Underdark, Baldur's Gate etc.) Might use AI to make choices that matter - would need to build my own AI to fuel this. I'll create pixel art assets (dice, characters, locations, maps etc.) to aid this. 

<h2>Roadmap:</h2>
<h3>1. Core Vision and Scope:</h3>
  - Single-player, turn-based experience that is text heavy with a pixel art flavor.
  - Close to DnD 5e with the games mechanics. 
  - Short game where every experience is different. 
<h3>2. Tech Foundation:</h3>
  - Set-up will be a python environment (pygame).
  - A minimal game loop with a window, main menu and ui. 
  - A working game that I can expand upon.
<h3>3. Character Creation:</h3>
  - Impletement race and class selections.
  - Include ability scores (Strength, Dexterity, Intelligence, etc.).
  - Dice-rolled stats.
  - Game will start with a PlayerCharacter object created at its start. 
<h3>3. World and Locations:</h3>
  - A simple world map with key locations (e.g. Waterdeep & Baldur's Gate).
  - Overworld map to move between locations, incorporates random encounters. 
  - A navigatable world structure.
<h3>Core Gameplay loop:</h3>
  - Encounters (social, combative, exploration), dice rolling, skill checks. 
  - Text driven with pixel art illustrations.
  - Play sessions where choices matter. 
<h3>AI-Driven choices:</h3>
  - "DM Brain"
  - System that reacts to stats, choices and history to branch events.
  - Game feels responsive and alive.
<h3>Polish and Assets:</h3>
  - Pixel art (characters, dice, locations, maps)
  - UI, feedback, sound, pacing.
